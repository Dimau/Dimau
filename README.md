<h1>Dmitrii Ushakov</h1>

Right now I am focused on **front-end** software development, but before that I had almost **10 years of experience in IT**. Most of this time I spent in IT companies (Yandex, SKB Kontur and other large Russian IT companies) as a project manager and product manager. During all this time, I have been trying to do my own projects as a programmer, because **I am in love with programming** and **really enjoy writing code with my own hands**. And now I finally decided to take a turn in my IT career and move to the role of a front-end developer :)

<h2>My strengths</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I know what the <b>business value</b> of a feature or product means</li>
  <li>I have a lot of experience in estimating development time for various features as a IT manager, it helps me with <b>reliable estimates</b> in a dev role</li>
  <li>Ability to <b>learn quickly</b> and with pleasure: I use my own knowledge system based on Evernote</li>
  <li>I can <b>communicate efficiently</b> with developers, with product owner and other stakeholders</li>
</ul>
