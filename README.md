<h1>Dmitrii Ushakov</h1>

Right now I'm focused on Front-End Dev, but before that I had almost 10-year IT career. Most of this time I spend in IT companies (Yandex, SKB Kontur and other big Russian IT companies) in Project and Product Manager role. I decided to make a pivot in my IT career for now and go to Front-End Dev role.

- 👀 I’m interested in JavaScript, React, Redux, Front-End software development
- 🌱 I’m currently on the junior level
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an project where I can help with front-end development 

<h2>My strengths</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I know what the <b>business value</b> of a feature or product means</li>
  <li>I have a lot of experience in estimating development time for various features, hopefully this will help me with <b>reliable estimates</b> in a new role</li>
  <li>Ability to <b>learn quickly</b> and with pleasure: I use my own knowledge system based on Evernote</li>
  <li>I can communicate efficiently with developers, with product owner and other stakeholders</li>
</ul>
